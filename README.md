Keep track of Python learning process

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Two important aspects of OOP: inheritance & composition
* Three distinct differences from modules: multiple instances, customization via inheritance, operator overloading
* OOP expression in Python: `object.attribute`
* Two types of OOP object: class objects & instance objects
  * class objects - shared by all instances; default behaviors
  * instance objects - owned by the instance only and vary for different instances

### Simplify OOP processes

1. Use `class` statement to generate class object
2. instance object is created when class is called
3. instances linked all classes above it, i.e., subclasses
4. subclasses then linked all superclasses as from bottom-to-top approach in left-to-right order

## Keyword Concepts

* class - design to create and manage new objects & support *inheritance*
* inheritance - mechanism of code customization & reuse
* strategic mode - long-term product development
* tactical mode - for short-supply
* methods - functions attached to classes as attributes
* polymorphism - care what it does and not what it is
