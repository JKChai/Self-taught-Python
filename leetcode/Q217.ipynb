    "There are 2 other approaches that are accepted, one is similar to my approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach #2 (Sorting) [Accepted]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are any duplicate integers, they will be consecutive after sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach employs sorting algorithm. Since comparison sorting algorithm like heapsort is known to provide $O(n \\log n)$ worst-case performance, sorting is often a good preprocessing step. After sorting, we can sweep the sorted array to find if there are any two consecutive duplicate elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {\n",
    "    Arrays.sort(nums);\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; ++i) {\n",
    "        if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) return true;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return false;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time complexity: $O(n \\log n)$. Sorting is $O(n \\log n)$ and the sweeping is $O(n)$. The entire algorithm is dominated by the sorting step, which is $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
    "* Space complexity: $O(1)$. Space depends on the sorting implementation which, usually, costs $O(1)$ auxiliary space if heapsort is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation here modifies the original array by sorting it. In general, it is not a good practice to modify the input unless it is clear to the caller that the input will be modified. One may make a copy of `nums` and operate on the copy instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach #3 (Hash Table) [Accepted]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize a dynamic data structure that supports fast search and insert operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Approach #1](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/solution/) we know that search operations is $O(n)$ in an unsorted array and we did so repeatedly. Utilizing a data structure with faster search time will speed up the entire algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many data structures commonly used as dynamic sets such as Binary Search Tree and Hash Table. The operations we need to support here are `search()` and `insert()`. For a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (TreeSet or TreeMap in Java), `search()` and `insert()` are both $O(\\log n)$ time. For a Hash Table (HashSet or HashMap in Java), `search()` and `insert()` are both $O(1)$ on average. Therefore, by using hash table, we can achieve linear time complexity for finding the duplicate in an unsorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {\n",
    "    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(nums.length);\n",
    "    for (int x: nums) {\n",
    "        if (set.contains(x)) return true;\n",
    "        set.add(x);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return false;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time complexity: $O(n)$. We do `search()` and `insert()` for $n$ times and each operation takes constant time.\n",
    "* Space complexity: $O(n)$. The space used by a hash table is linear with the number of elements in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "For certain test cases with not very large $n$, the runtime of this method can be slower than Approach #2. The reason is hash table has some overhead in maintaining its property. One should keep in mind that real world performance can be different from what the Big-O notation says. The Big-O notation only tells us that for sufficiently large input, one will be faster than the other. Therefore, when $n$ is not sufficiently large, an $O(n)$ algorithm can be slower than an $O(n \\log n)$ algorithm.\n"
