    "In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an `m x n` matrix into a new one with a different size `r x c` keeping its original data.\n",

    "You are given an `m x n` matrix mat and two integers `r` and `c` representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.\n",

    "The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.\n",

While putting the numbers in the resultant array, we fix a particular row and keep on incrementing the column numbers only till we reach the end of the required columns indicated by $c$. At this moment, we update the row index by incrementing it and reset the column index to start from 0 again. Thus, we can save the space consumed by the queue for storing the data that just needs to be copied into a new array.\n",

    "In the last approach, we needed to keep a track of when we reached the end of columns for the resultant matrix and needed to update the current row and column number for putting the extracted elements by checking the current indices every time. Instead of doing these limit checks at every step, we can make use of maths to help ease the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this approach is as follows. Do you know how a 2-D array is stored in the main memory(which is 1-D in nature)? It is internally represented as a 1-D array only. The element $nums[i][j]$ of `nums` array is represented in the form of a one dimensional array by using the index in the form: $nums[n*i + j]$, where nn is the number of columns in the given matrix. Looking at the same in the reverse order, while putting the elements in the elements in the resultant matrix, we can make use of a countcount variable which gets incremented for every element traversed as if we are putting the elements in a 1-D resultant array. But, to convert the countcount back into 2-D matrix indices with a column count of $c$, we can obtain the indices as $res[count/c][count\\%c]$ where $count/c$ is the row number and $count\\%c$ is the column number. Thus, we can save the extra checking required at each step.\n",
