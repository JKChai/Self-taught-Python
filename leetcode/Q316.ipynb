    "\n",
    "**Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "First we should make sure we understand what \"lexicographical order\" means. Comparing strings doesn't work the same way as comparing numbers. Strings are compared from the first character to the last one. Which string is greater depends on the comparison between the first unequal corresponding character in the two strings. As a result any string beginning with `a` will always be less than any string beginning with `b`, regardless of the ends of both strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, the optimal solution will have the smallest characters as early as possible. We draw two conclusions that provide different methods of solving this problem in $O(N)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "The leftmost letter in our solution will be the smallest letter such that the suffix from that letter contains every other. This is because we know that the solution must have one copy of every letter, and we know that the solution will have the lexicographically smallest leftmost character possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are multiple smallest letters, then we pick the leftmost one simply because it gives us more options. We can always eliminate more letters later on, so the optimal solution will always remain in our search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we iterate over our string, if character `i` is greater than character `i+1` and another occurrence of character `i` exists later in the string, deleting character `i` will always lead to the optimal solution. Characters that come later in the string `i` don't matter in this calculation because `i` is in a more significant spot. Even if character `i+1` isn't the best yet, we can always replace it for a smaller character down the line if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we try to remove characters as early as possible, and picking the best letter at each step leads to the best solution, \"greedy\" should be going off like an alarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: Greedy - Solving Letter by Letter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use idea number one from the intuition. In each iteration, we determine leftmost letter in our solution. This will be the smallest character such that its suffix contains at least one copy of every character in the string. We determine the rest our answer by recursively calling the function on the suffix we generate from the original string (leftmost letter is removed).\n",

This means that the total amount of time spent in the inner loop is bounded by $O(N)$, giving us a total time complexity of $O(N)$\n",
    "* Space complexity : $O(1)$. At first glance it looks like this is $O(N)$, but that is not true! seen will only contain unique elements, so it's bounded by the number of characters in the alphabet (a constant). You can only add to stack if an element has not been seen, so stack also only consists of unique elements. This means that both stack and seen are bounded by constant, giving us $O(1)$ space complexity.\n"
