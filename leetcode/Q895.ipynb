    "# Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: Stack of Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently, we care about the frequency of an element. Let `freq` be a `Map` from $x$ to the number of occurrences of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we (probably) care about `maxfreq`, the current maximum frequency of any element in the stack. This is clear because we must pop the element with the maximum frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question then becomes: among elements with the same (maximum) frequency, how do we know which element is most recent? We can use a stack to query this information: the top of the stack is the most recent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, let `group` be a map from frequency to a stack of elements with that frequency. We now have all the required components to implement `FreqStack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, as an implementation level detail, if `x` has frequency `f`, then we'll have `x` in all `group[i] (i <= f)`, not just the top. This is because each `group[i]` will store information related to the ith copy of `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, our goal is just to maintain `freq`, `group`, and `maxfreq` as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FreqStack(object):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.freq = collections.Counter()\n",
    "        self.group = collections.defaultdict(list)\n",
    "        self.maxfreq = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def push(self, x):\n",
    "        f = self.freq[x] + 1\n",
    "        self.freq[x] = f\n",
    "        if f > self.maxfreq:\n",
    "            self.maxfreq = f\n",
    "        self.group[f].append(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def pop(self):\n",
    "        x = self.group[self.maxfreq].pop()\n",
    "        self.freq[x] -= 1\n",
    "        if not self.group[self.maxfreq]:\n",
    "            self.maxfreq -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time Complexity: $O(1)$ for both `push` and `pop` operations.\n",
    "* Space Complexity: $O(N)$, where `N` is the number of elements in the `FreqStack`."
