    "To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to get its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the lookup time from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$ by trading space for speed. A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time. I say \"near\" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to $O(n)$ time. However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized $O(1)$ time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.\n",

    "A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table. Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement $(target - nums[i])$ exists in the hash table. If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be $nums[i]$ itself!\n",
